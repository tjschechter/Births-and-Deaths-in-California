  "description": "This dataset contains counts of deaths for California as a whole based on information entered on death certificates. Final counts are derived from static data and include out-of-state deaths to California residents, whereas provisional counts are derived from incomplete and dynamic data. Provisional counts are based on the records available when the data was retrieved and may not represent all deaths that occurred during the time period. Deaths involving injuries from external or environmental forces, such as accidents, homicide and suicide, often require additional investigation that tends to delay certification of the cause and manner of death. This can result in significant under-reporting of these deaths in provisional data.\r\n\r\nThe final data tables include both deaths that occurred in California regardless of the place of residence (by occurrence) and deaths to California residents (by residence), whereas the provisional data table only includes deaths that occurred in California regardless of the place of residence (by occurrence). The data are reported as totals, as well as stratified by age, gender, race-ethnicity, and death place type. Deaths due to all causes (ALL) and selected underlying cause of death categories are provided. See temporal coverage for more information on which combinations are available for which years.\r\n\r\nThe cause of death categories are based solely on the underlying cause of death as coded by the International Classification of Diseases. The underlying cause of death is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as \"the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury.\" It is a single value assigned to each death based on the details as entered on the death certificate. When more than one cause is listed, the order in which they are listed can affect which cause is coded as the underlying cause. This means that similar events could be coded with different underlying causes of death depending on variations in how they were entered. Consequently, while underlying cause of death provides a convenient comparison between cause of death categories, it may not capture the full impact of each cause of death as it does not always take into account all conditions contributing to the death.",

            "description": "The cause of death categories are based solely on the underlying cause of death as coded by the International Classification of Diseases. The underlying cause of death is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as \"the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury.\" It is a single value assigned to each death based on the details as entered on the death certificate. When more than one cause is listed, the order in which they are listed can affect which cause is coded as the underlying cause. This means that similar events could be coded with different underlying causes of death depending on variations in how they were entered. Consequently, while underlying cause of death provides a convenient comparison between cause of death categories, it may not capture the full impact of each cause of death as it does not always take into account all conditions contributing to the death.\r\n\r\nProvided as a three-character code:\r\n\r\n- ALL = All causes (total)\r\n- ALZ = Alzheimer's disease [G30]\r\n- CAN = Malignant neoplasms (cancers) [C00-C97]\r\n- CLD = Chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD) [J40-J47]\r\n- DIA = Diabetes mellitus [E10-E14]\r\n- HOM = Assault (homicide) [\\*U01-\\*U02, X85-Y09, Y87.1]\r\n- HTD = Diseases of heart [I00-I09, I11, I13, I20-I51]\r\n- HYP = Essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease [I10, I12, I15]\r\n- INJ = Accidents (unintentional injuries) [V01-X59, Y85-Y86]\r\n- LIV = Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis [K70, K73-K74]\r\n- NEP = Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis [N00-N07, N17-N19, N25-N27]\r\n- PAR = Parkinson's disease [G20-G21]\r\n- PNF = Pneumonia and influenza [J09-J18]\r\n- STK = Cerebrovascular disease (stroke) [I60-I69]\r\n- SUI = Intentional self-harm (suicide) [\\*U03, X60-X84, Y87.0]\r\n\r\nCause of death categories for years 1999 and later are based on the tenth revision of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes listed. Comparable categories are provided for years 1979 through 1998 based on ninth revision (ICD-9) codes. For more information on the comparability of cause of death classification between ICD revisions see [Comparability of Cause-of-death Between ICD Revisions](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality/comparability_icd.htm).\r\n\r\nThe previously included OTH category for all other causes of death is no longer provided.
